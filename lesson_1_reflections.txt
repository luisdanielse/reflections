How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Because Diff show me the differences between two files. The first file was the previous code that i had when the software was working perfectly. The second one, is the file with some error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because it could be helpful whenever we need a past version that has suffered many changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros could be that we are taking control about what and whenever we want to save.
Cons could be that we could forget to do commit or we could be missing a change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because a new feature or a change in coding terms, could involve more than one file. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log show us all the changes that the project has been suffered through all the commits, while git diff show us the differences between two certain commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because if I break something with the added code, I can go back to a previous version that I had.

***** Here starts the second commit
From here, we are modyfing the file for having another commit.
